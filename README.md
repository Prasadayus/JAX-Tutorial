# **JAX Tutorials 🚀**  

Welcome to the **JAX Tutorials** repository! This repository contains various tutorials and implementations to help you understand and utilize **JAX for high-performance machine learning and deep learning**.  

## **About JAX**  
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is an open-source library developed by Google for **numerical computing and machine learning**. It provides:  
✅ **Autograd** – Automatic differentiation for high-performance computing.  
✅ **Vectorization (vmap)** – Simplifies batch processing.  
✅ **Parallelization (pmap)** – Distributes computations across multiple devices (GPUs/TPUs).  
✅ **Just-In-Time Compilation (jit)** – Uses XLA to optimize performance.

## **Tutorials Covered 📚**  
🔹 **Basic JAX Operations** – NumPy-like operations, JIT compilation, automatic differentiation.  
🔹 **Linear Regression with JAX** – Implementing a simple model with gradient updates.  
🔹 **Parallel Training with `pmap`** – Distributing computations across multiple GPUs/TPUs.  
🔹 **Custom Neural Networks** – Implementing a simple MLP with JAX.  
🔹 **Optimizers in JAX** – Using optimizers like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop.  

Each tutorial includes well-documented code and explanations.
